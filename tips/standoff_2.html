                    <br />
                    <p>Preparing to play Standoff 2<br />
                        While playing campaign mode may not require much thought, playing Standoff 2 (or any game for
                        that
                        matter) in a competitive mode will require some optimization for the best experience.
                        Optimization
                        measures become more important, especially on older phones or devices. The reality is, that
                        playing
                        any kind of FPS or MOBA game at an optimal level greatly depends on the frame rate output of the
                        device. Frame rate is measured in frames per second. One strategy to improve gaming performance
                        on
                        older devices is to power cycle the device before launching the game. It is also a good idea to
                        close any unnecessary programs running in the background, such as Bluetooth connections, WIFI,
                        and
                        other programs. The controls and gameplay mechanic for Standoff 2 is almost identical to other
                        FPS
                        games like Call of Duty, Modern Strike Online, etc. There are some minor differences that may
                        trip
                        you up, crouching being one of those instances. You must press the crouching button once to
                        crouch
                        and once more to get in the normal walking position. Perhaps one of the best features of the
                        game is
                        the ability to customize the controls and in-game settings to your liking.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>The best settings for one player may not be so great for another. However, the following seems to
                        be
                        the optimal settings:<br />
                        1.&nbsp;Game detail setting: Depending on your device, you will need to tweak the detail
                        settings to
                        achieve a balance of good visuals and good performance with high frame rates.<br/>
                        Turn off switch weapons on pickup: It can be a nuisance at times to switch back to a prior
                        weapon
                        after picking up a new weapon. Turning off this option allows you to add items to inventory and
                        equip them as needed. Switch weapons on pick up may be useful for new players testing out
                        different
                        weapons. But for an advanced player, its may only be a stumbling block.<br />
                        2.&nbsp;Button sensitivity: Button sensitivity will depend on your personal preference. However,
                        higher
                        sensitivity is usually better for the most part. After finding a good setting, try to stick to
                        it.<br />
                        3.&nbsp;Turn off acceleration: It is recommended that you disable (set to 0) acceleration for
                        best
                        results, at least at first. The acceleration setting in Standoff 2 controls the sensitivity for
                        the
                        camera or player swivel movements. Most players turn this off or set it very low and compensate
                        for
                        this by tracking their forward and back movements.<br />
                        4.&nbsp;Crosshair customization settings: The crosshair can also be set based on your own
                        liking. The
                        crosshair setting that works best is, point size 0, line thickness between 5.0 and 10.0, line
                        length
                        between 20 and 25, and line distance between 2.0 and 3.0.<br />
                        5.&nbsp;Another good tip is to disable any unnecessary options in the game. Taking these steps
                        will
                        help
                        to eliminate any potential latency or lag.<br />
                    </p><br />
                    <p>The best weapons<br />
                        The ideal weapon will vary based on a player's preference, skill level, and game mode. Based on
                        damage and fire rate, the AKR is the best weapon. These are the best weapons in order of best to
                        worst based on these numbers:
                    </p><br />
                    <p> 1.&nbsp;AKR<br/>
                        2.&nbsp;M4<br/>
                        3.&nbsp;M16<br/>
                        4.&nbsp;AKR12<br/>
                        Understanding the maps<br/>
                        The player most familiar with his surrounding will dominate. The important thing is not to so
                        much
                        react to an opponent, but instead to expect and anticipate their positions. To do that you will
                        need
                        to get good at mapping the radar display on the top left with the actual environment. It's
                        important
                        to know where enemies can and canâ€™t emerge from. Learn what positions they can flank from. With
                        this
                        knowledge, as you move through the map, you will be one step ahead of the opponent.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Game modes<br />
                        There are several game modes to choose from in Standoff 2. However, we will only cover the two
                        most
                        popular. A team deathmatch is the standard 10-minute round where teams of five-player go head to
                        head. The team with the most kills after 10 minutes wins the match. Team deathmatch is the best
                        game
                        mode to gain experience points and improve overall skills. In diffused game mode, one team is
                        the
                        counter-terrorist and the other team is the terrorist. The counter-terrorist team must prevent
                        the
                        terrorist team from planting and setting off the bomb. Meanwhile, the terrorist team must plant
                        the
                        bomb and guard it so the other team does not deactivate it. Defused is perhaps the most
                        entertaining
                        game mode in Standoff 2.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Mastering reaction times<br />
                        Improving reactions times along with the other tactics in this guide is enough to take your game
                        from beginner to pro. The first tip to improving your reaction time is to always keep the
                        crosshair
                        at head height. It is also a good point to get to know the weapon you are using. Get to know its
                        range and recoil patterns. By using burst fire, you can improve spread control. Also, get to
                        know
                        your opponents. What path do they take? Are they in groups? How fast are they rushing or not
                        rushing? Try to pick up on patterns in their actions. By doing that, you can pick up a lot of
                        information on your opponent and be ten steps ahead of them. Rather than holding a controller,
                        you
                        would be holding a phone. The claw form is basically the equivalent to keeping the fingers on
                        the
                        home keys of a keyboard. It may look awkward and complicated at first, but it doesnâ€™t take long
                        to
                        get accustomed. You can tweak your button placements until you find a good grip for your liking.
