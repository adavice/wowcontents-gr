                    <br />

                    <p>Intro<br />
                        What’s not that old is new again: Mario Kart is hitting the pavement on the Nintendo Switch, and
                        just about everything you knew and loved from the original Wii U edition is back. Naturally,
                        there
                        are a few other surprises, so here’s a rundown of some of the most useful advice.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Hold items, especially if you’re ahead<br />
                        In the original Mario Kart, holding an item behind your kart wouldn’t remove it from your
                        currently
                        held arsenal. That has not changed in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but there are now two active item
                        slots,
                        so you have more wiggle room and can make more liberal use of your items regardless of your
                        current
                        standing. One of the oldest Mario Kart tricks is to hold an item like a shell or banana behind
                        you
                        to block shots or automatically hit someone who’s tailgating you. Upon impact, the item will be
                        consumed — its job is done, and you can grab a new item. Get in the habit of cycling through
                        objects
                        or putting them in situations where you can use them instead of hoarding them. There is one
                        exception: the super horn, which you can use to blow up a blue shell when you’re in the first
                        place.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Check your rearview mirror<br />
                        One thing a lot of players overlook is the dedicated rearview mirror button. On the Switch, all
                        you
                        need to do is press X and you look behind you as long as you hold the button down.<br/>
                        Get in the habit of doing this often when you’re ahead. Even if you’re just looking back when
                        you
                        have an item in your possession that you can hold or throw backward (bananas, shells, bombs),
                        swapping constantly will help you better aim your power-ups and stay in the front of the pack.<br/>
                        Also keep in mind that boxing out enemies that are behind you isn’t always a good thing,
                        especially
                        when you consider slipstreams (which we’ll talk about momentarily). Try to stay away from enemy
                        karts that are behind you at all times.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>If you’re behind, get a slipstream boost<br />
                        Introduced very early in the series, a slipstream (or draft) is a slight speed boost when
                        tailgating
                        directly behind an opposing racer. After roughly one second, a wind effect will appear (it's
                        really
                        faint, especially if you're playing split-screen) and provide a small increase in speed. If
                        you’re
                        not in first place, always look for opportunities to slipstream. You can identify players who
                        don’t
                        make use of their rearview, and thus aren’t aware of your presence. Combining a slipstream boost
                        followed by the use of an item (right as you’re about to pass them and lose the boost) is one of
                        the
                        best ways to get a major lead on someone. And it prevents them from reacting with their own
                        item.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Perfect your start of race boost timing<br />
                        Getting that massive jump start at the beginning of a race is a Mario Kart staple. For some,
                        it’s
                        muscle memory. But if you aren’t consistently getting that initial boost, keep in mind that
                        there is
                        a science to it. Everyone has their own formula, but the easiest way we found is to focus in on
                        Lakitu on the right side of the screen. Right as he turns on the second light (or directly after
                        the
                        second chime sounds), press the A button and hold it. Even if you’re a little late, you’ll
                        obtain a
                        small boost, though there is a maximum boost if you can nail it perfectly. If you aren’t
                        confident
                        in your abilities yet and don’t have time to practice, just don’t use the boost at all. Time it
                        incorrectly, and you’ll just spin out in place and be worse off than if you had just never tried
                        to
                        boost.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Use deluxe’s training wheels if you need them<br />
                        In addition to tilt controls, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe introduces two new mechanics intended to ease
                        newcomers into the fray: smart steering and auto acceleration. You can check to see if these
                        settings are enabled by pressing the + button while choosing a kart before a match or by pausing
                        in
                        the middle of a race. Smart steering will not let you drive off of the track, even if you try
                        your
                        hardest. Think of it like a smart car steering system and an invisible bumper (like kiddie
                        bowling
                        lanes) at the same time. You can see the effect by way of a vibrating antenna that comes out of
                        your
                        kart. As a downside, you cannot use the new level of boost when smart steering is on. It should
                        get
                        you through lower difficulties against CPUs just fine, but its efficacy against other more
                        experienced players is another matter.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Memorize double item box locations<br />
                        As we noted above, Mario Kart 8 introduces double item boxes and double item slots for all
                        modes.
                        The placement of these boxes is deliberate, but you may not want to go for them every time. Take
                        Wild Woods for example. On the second set of item boxes, the third box over will always be a
                        double
                        item box. It’s advantageous to go for them if you can, as two items are clearly better than one.
                        However, if there’s a large crowd of opponents around you (especially at the start of a race),
                        you
                        can bet that they’ll all be fighting over it. Sometimes aiming for the side that’s on the
                        opposite
                        side of the double item box will ensure that you don’t get a box snatched from you at the most
                        inopportune moment.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Hit your stunt boosts on every ramp<br />
                        The R button isn’t just for drifting, as it can trigger stunt boosts roughly every 10 seconds on
                        any
                        given track. The easiest locations to enact stunt boosts are ramps, whether they’re short ones
                        marked with a caret symbol (^) or obvious ramps that are glowing and allow your kart to sprout
                        wings. You don’t need to have the timing down perfectly. Just press R right before you leap off
                        of
                        an edge, and you’ll get a small boost. It’s obvious when it happens — your character will turn
                        and
                        face the camera, the controller will rumble and you’ll get a sound effect. We can’t stress
                        enough
                        how often you can and should use this ability. Even if it’s the tiniest ramp or the smallest
                        ledge,
                        try pressing R to see if it triggers a stunt boost. Make a mental note of it, and repeat it
                        every
                        run. It seems tedious at first, but it’ll soon be second nature.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Aim for the shortcuts if you can hit them consistently<br />
                        Unlike many other entries in the series, Mario Kart's shortcuts are generally more nuanced. Most
                        of
                        them won’t outright win you the race but will shave several seconds off your run in each
                        instance,
                        saving you precious time in a heated competition or in a time trial. A perfect example is the
                        last
                        corner in Cloudtop Cruise, right before the finish line. You could take the bend all the way
                        around,
                        or hop right onto the two giant leaves (with a stunt boost, of course). Another common shortcut
                        is
                        to use a boost item to shoot past a gravel off-track area that would normally slow you down.
                        Typically this design is found in more traditional racetrack courses like Mario Kart Stadium, so
                        save your mushrooms or stars (or burn off items if you’re in the first place to get them) for
                        these
                        bends. Just like anything in Mario Kart, ramming your kart against the wall to try and nail a
                        shortcut in a versus environment isn’t the best way to spend your time. Practice each individual
                        track on your own, and build it into your memory.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The only major unlock is gold Mario<br />
                        Veterans will be pleased to hear that, outside of collecting coins to unlock a handful of
                        vehicle
                        parts, there’s only one primary unlock — Gold Mario. As another take on Metal Mario, you'll need
                        to
                        clear every 200cc difficulty cup in the game to unlock him. You’ll need to score a gold medal
                        (win)
                        in all 12 cups, which includes all of the original and DLC cups. If you’re up for the challenge,
                        select Grand Prix mode, then 200cc, and any character you want. To clear 200cc (the fastest
                        speed
                        setting in the game), you’ll need to actually use the brake, which you’ll likely never use
                        anywhere
                        else. It can get really frustrating if you don’t practice that simple concept. If you don’t pop
                        it
                        consistently, you can fall off a cliff and doom your entire run.
