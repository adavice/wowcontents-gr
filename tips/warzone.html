                    <br />
                    <p>Warzone modes: Battle Royale & Plunder<br/>
                        Warzone includes two separate PvP multiplayer modes: Battle Royale, and Plunder. Both modes are
                        available to select from the main Warzone menu. Taking place on the colossal map Verdansk, you
                        must
                        drop down alone or as a team, gear up, avoid the encroaching circular border, and fight to be
                        the
                        last one standing out of up to 150 players. Plunder is a slightly less tense game mode, where
                        the
                        aim is to accrue as much Cash as possible before time runs out. You can earn Cash by looting the
                        map, completing contracts, and killing other players. If you die you respawn within a few
                        seconds,
                        but you lose all your Cash.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Vehicles in Warzone<br/>
                        There are five types of vehicles available in Warzone, and you can find many of each type
                        scattered
                        across the map every match. Here’s how Infinity Ward describes each one:<br/>
                        ATV - a two-seater, provides minimal protection, good at off-roading, fast.<br/>
                        Tactical Rover - four-seater, provides minimal protection, solidly fast, solid at off-roading.<br/>
                        SUV - four-seater, provides good protection, medium speed, not ideal for off-roading.<br/>
                        Cargo Truck - holds the squad plus equipment, excellent protection, not for off-roading,
                        slowest.<br/>
                        Helicopter - four-seater, decent coverage, flies.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Cash & Contracts<br/>
                        Cash is the currency of the Warzone game modes. In Plunder, the aim is to earn the most cash,
                        but
                        it’s also an extremely important resource in the Battle Royale mode. There are several ways to
                        earn
                        Cash. You can find Cash strewn about the world as loot; you can kill other players to earn cash
                        rewards, and you can pick up and complete Contracts. There are multiple different types of
                        Contracts
                        that can be activated by picking up the Contract dossier as a loot drop. Your squad can only
                        activate one Contract at a time. Some contacts may include finding and opening supply boxes,
                        killing
                        specific targets, or securing a specific location, just to name a few. As well as earning you
                        Cash,
                        completing Contracts may earn your team unique abilities such as seeing the next circle location
                        before it starts to close.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Heal between fights<br/>
                        Cash is so important in Warzone Battle Royale because of Buy Stations. There are many Buy
                        Stations
                        scattered across the map (which you can see on the map overlay), and they all offer you powerful
                        upgrades and rewards in exchange for Cash. Examples of what you can buy at Buy Stations include
                        Field Upgrades such as UAV drones, equipment such as Armor Plates and Gas Masks; and even lethal
                        Killstreak rewards such as airstrikes. But most importantly, with enough Cash, you can use a Buy
                        Station to deploy a Loadout Drop. This will drop a crate at your location which will allow you
                        to
                        pick a preset loadout of weapons, perks, and equipment - the ultimate reward.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Survival is important (don’t give up)<br/>
                        As obvious of a tip this may seem, Warzone takes a slightly different approach to the loop of
                        running, gunning, and quitting to join another game after getting gunned down. Between the Gulag
                        system and the ample Buy stations scattered around the map, there are lots of chances for your
                        squad
                        to get back to fighting strength, and possibly make a tremendous comeback. While other
                        squad-focused
                        battle royale games inspire feelings of dread and aimlessness after your teammates have been
                        wiped,
                        you still have a decent shot at reviving them if you have the cash and can manage to evade
                        danger--provided they haven't quit the game. Compared to other BR games, it's pretty easy to get
                        teammates back in Warzone--but you can't do that if you're dead. So stay focused and calm, even
                        when
                        the odds are against you.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Don’t forget to mount your weapon!<br/>
                        Warzone's tutorial does a good job of teaching you the absolute basics, including one aspect
                        you'll
                        be familiar with if you've played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: the ability to mount your
                        weapon.
                        This involves using an object nearby to steady your weapon, reducing the amount of recoil you
                        have
                        to compensate for when firing your gun. Understandably, this can be easy to forget in the middle
                        of
                        combat. While there are certainly times that it's better to maintain your mobility, the ability
                        to
                        fire accurately can mean the difference between life and death in certain engagements. Try to
                        make
                        use of this early and often as you begin playing Warzone so that you can build muscle memory
                        rather
                        than allowing this ability to become an afterthought.
