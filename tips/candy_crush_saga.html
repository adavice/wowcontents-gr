                        How To Crush Locked Candies<br />
                        From "Level 36" onwards, you will encounter locked candies. These are regular candies, but are
                        "locked." You cannot move them or swap them with other candies unless you make the right moves
                        in
                        the game. Look at the possible match of 3 green candies. Swapping the green candy with the red
                        one
                        will not unlock the purple-locked candy. To get rid of these locks, you need to swap the locked
                        candies with other same-colored candies. Now, look at the possible match of orange candies.
                        Swapping
                        the orange candy with the red one will unlock the locked orange candy. However, this move will
                        not
                        eliminate this orange candy with the other two orange candies. This means that you need to match
                        it
                        one more time.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Seek the Special Candy Always<br />
                        The basic premise in Candy Crush is to match three identical pieces of candy to cause an
                        explosion
                        and clear part of the board. This is the most basic move you can do in the game. However, while
                        clearing the board is always important, the actual objective of every round will vary per level.
                        Sometimes, the objective is to clear a certain number of pieces, and other times it’s to clear
                        specific pieces, such as jelly, off the board. Nevertheless, the objectives are always easy to
                        grasp
                        and are always displayed in the top left corner of the screen. While matching three pieces is a
                        surefire way to cause some ruckus on the board, this basic technique will fall short a few
                        levels
                        into the game, where the objective is to clear large amounts of pieces with only a few moves. In
                        these cases, you’ll need to learn the fine art of seeking special candies. Whenever you make
                        certain
                        combinations of pieces in Candy Crush, you’ll create special pieces of candies that can cause a
                        wide
                        variety of effects when combined with other pieces. Here is a list of the special pieces in
                        Candy
                        Crush, and how to get them: Striped Candy: Created by combining 4 candies of the same color.
                        These
                        pieces, once combined, can clear the entire row or column. The direction they clear, either
                        vertical
                        or horizontal, varies according to the swipe with which it was created. Wrapped Candy: Created
                        by
                        combining 5 candies in a T or L shape. These special pieces, once combined and activated,
                        explode
                        breaking the 8 pieces surrounding them. Color Bomb: The most valuable piece of special candy,
                        obtained by combining 5 pieces in a straight line. When you combine this piece with any other
                        piece
                        of a certain color, all the pieces of that color are removed from the board. Experienced players
                        know absolutely everything about these special candies and will do everything in their power to
                        actively seek them out. These pieces are the key to clearing boards, scoring high, and beating
                        every
                        level.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Ignore the Move Suggestions<br />
                        Oftentimes, these match-three games insist on making move suggestions in the most obnoxious way
                        possible, and Candy Crush is no exception. Whenever you’re idle for a few seconds after making a
                        move, the game will highlight certain pieces, indicating a suggested move. In some cases, these
                        suggestions are useful since you can simply listen to them and complete a level without an
                        issue.
                        However, in levels where the objective is particularly tough, these suggestions aren’t always
                        the
                        optimal moves, and heeding them will only lead to failure. If you still haven’t completed the
                        objective, try to consider moves other than the ones the game is suggesting. Scan the board,
                        look
                        for combinations that could create special pieces, and use these to clear the level. When it
                        comes
                        to rounds where the objective is clearing jelly or other special blocks, the wrapped and striped
                        candies are particularly useful since they can clear multiple pieces in a single blow.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Boosters are Useful<br />
                        As you progress through the levels in Candy Crush Saga, you’ll progressively unlock different
                        items
                        that, when used, create special effects on the board that can help you to achieve your
                        objective.
                        These items are called boosters and, while the Candy Crush pros consider them cheating, they can
                        make the difference between clearing a mission on the first try and wasting all your lives on a
                        single level. These boosters, once activated, can create different effects such as granting
                        extra
                        moves, generating different effects on the field, and creating special pieces that you can
                        activate
                        for clearing the board, among others. However, they are consumed upon use and are quite
                        difficult to
                        unlock, unless you decide to buy them with real money. You can apply these three essential tips
                        on
                        literally any level in Candy Crush Saga in order to clear them on the first go. Sure, there’s a
                        degree of luck involved, but it’s important to learn and always keep the fundamentals in mind if
                        you
                        want to save your lives and keep playing for as long as possible.</p>
