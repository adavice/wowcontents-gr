                    <br />
                    <p>Find a team that fits you<br />
                        Find a team you get along with. Sometimes in life, we're all thrown into a situation where we
                        have
                        to work with people we aren't so fond of. Like at PC Gamer, for example. Bloody scoundrels, the
                        lot
                        of them. But there's no doubting that getting on with your teammates is going to make things a
                        whole
                        lot easier down the line. In fact, it might even be better to pick friendly souls with the
                        potential
                        to improve than switching in the cream of the crop without knowing them well. "Playing with
                        people
                        you get along with will make you enjoy the game much more, and undoubtedly be more likely to
                        stick
                        together," says Elliot. "Changing your lineup every month won't do you much good, even if you're
                        replacing a player with someone slightly better.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Practice in the right environment<br />
                        Practice your tactics in the best environments If you're considering competitive Counter-Strike,
                        then chances are you'll already spend a fair number of hours playing the game. But practicing in
                        the
                        right environments is key to your continual improvement. Deathmatch servers are a good place to
                        start - "You respawn as soon as you die, so you're constantly shooting and it's a good way to
                        improve your gunplay," Elliot explains - and clan war practice is pretty much essential. Use a
                        chat
                        program such as mIRC to search for practice games against other teams, and try out all the
                        tactics
                        you've been mulling over in your head. "I'd advise having ten minutes after each match you play
                        to
                        assess what you did wrong, what you did right, and how you could improve. Forget the rest, play
                        against the best It's always nice to win, so it might be tempting to select weaker opponents for
                        practice matches. But this can be counter-productive. Unless you're playing at the highest level
                        you're capable of, there's not a great deal of compulsion to improve - and certainly less you
                        can
                        take away from both victories and defeats.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Communication<br />
                        Communication is key As with all team-based games, but perhaps even more so with Counter-Strike,
                        it's important to be in good contact with your teammates throughout a match. A lack of
                        communication
                        can be the difference between a decisive victory and an embarrassing, crushing defeat, so
                        talking to
                        each other is tremendously important. But simply maintaining contact isn't enough: it's
                        imperative
                        to be efficient with your communications. "It's best to keep your calls about what's happening
                        short
                        and quick, and explain everything you know, such as how many enemies you see, if you see the
                        bomb
                        carrier, and what weapons they have," says Elliot. And be sure to get hold of a voice chat
                        program
                        such as Ventrilo or Mumble to utilize during practice: they allow you to speak to your teammates
                        whether you're dead or alive, an advantage not afforded by Counter-Strike's in-game chat system.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Change tactics and positioning each round<br />
                        Enemies get used to your position and know where to expect you in future rounds. Change your
                        tactics
                        and change your positioning. Even if you change your spot or exit point just a little bit, it
                        can
                        confuse your enemies.<br/>
                        Selecting the right position gives you an advantage over the enemy. Use the structures on the
                        map
                        and reduce your opponentâ€™s viewing angle to easily best your opposition.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Learn all points of the maps<br />
                        Before you start playing on any map, it is necessary to thoroughly study it. Understanding the
                        maps
                        in CSGO distinguishes a professional player from a beginner. Professionals know where their
                        enemy
                        can appear and know how to move around in any situation. Knowing the maps will also boost your
                        efficiency and speed while communicating with your teammates.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Grenades more dangerous than the main weapon<br />
                        According to statistics, beginners hardly throw grenades and mid-rank players throw a lot of
                        grenades, but they often do so thoughtlessly. Professionals also use a lot of grenades, but they
                        do
                        it most effectively. Each grenade can do more good than any other firearm. The right smoke
                        covering
                        the right choke point or pass gives time to pick up on the enemy or to stop the fastest rush.
                    </p>
