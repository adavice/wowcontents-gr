                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Remember that progress is gated by real-life days<br />
                        If you're new to Animal Crossing, or it's been a spell since you last hung out with Tom Nook and
                        co,
                        it's easy to forget that this is not a game that you can rush. Progress, especially at first, is
                        doled out slowly, restricting access to certain activities/items/buildings according to how many
                        real-world days you've spent in the game. Take it, easy folks, there's no rushing island life.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>You have to learn a recipe before you can craft it<br />
                        If you're given, or otherwise find a recipe card, you'll have to learn it before it appears in
                        your
                        crafting options. Just head to the item in your inventory by pressing X, and then hit learn.
                        Then
                        it's yours to craft forever!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Pay off your moving costs to unlock new options<br />
                        On your first full day on your new island, Tom Nook gives you a rather large bill to cover all
                        of
                        your moving costs. Thankfully, you can pay it in Nook Miles - and a fairly reasonable 5,000 Nook
                        Miles at that - and we'd advise making it the first thing you do on the island. Once you've paid
                        off
                        Mr. Nook, you'll unlock a whole load of new options. Firstly, you'll be able to take out a new
                        loan,
                        which will automatically let you upgrade from a tent to a house. It's a loan of 98,000 bells,
                        but
                        your new home will be built by the next morning, and then you can start repayment. This unlocks
                        the
                        ability to hoard items in your home's in-built storage, which is very handy indeed. But, that's
                        not
                        all. You'll also unlock the Nook Miles Rewards at the Nook Stop terminal in Residents' Services,
                        which opens up a whole load of items, recipes, and more. Plus, once you've taken out your new
                        home
                        loan, you'll unlock Nook Miles+, which is a selection of five straightforward tasks that
                        constantly
                        replenish as a way of earning Nook Miles more quickly and easily. For example, these range from
                        catching five fish or selling 10 shells, to chatting to three neighbors or planting one tree. So
                        many perks, so little time!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>You won't get all the tools you'll need straight away<br />
                        You won't be able to get access to all the usual tools straight away in Animal Crossing: New
                        Horizons. On your first full morning, Tom Nook will give you recipes for the flimsy fishing rod
                        and
                        flimsy net, but it's not until you meet Blathers at his little pop-up museum tent that he'll
                        give
                        you recipes for the shovel and vault pole. You can buy a watering can recipe and the slingshot
                        from
                        the Nook nephews though, but you might have to wait a day or two for them to appear in rotation.
                        <br />
                    <p>Flimsy tools are your friends in the early days<br />
                        Because iron nuggets are a bit of a rarity at first, try and use the flimsy tools as much as you
                        can
                        initially. They are all made from materials that are easily found on your own island. Tree
                        branches
                        can be shaken free from trees all day, repeatedly. Stone can be found by hitting rocks.
                        Softwood,
                        hardwood, and wood can be found by hitting trees with a flimsy ax or stone ax. It's a lot easier
                        to
                        replenish your stock of these items than iron nuggets at first, so stick to the flimsy tools at
                        first. Then, when you're ready, you can buy yourself the Pretty Good Tools Recipes from the Nook
                        Miles section of the Nook Stop, which are mostly powered by iron nuggets.</p>
                    <br />
