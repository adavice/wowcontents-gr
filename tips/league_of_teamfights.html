                    <br />
                    <p>Let Your Money Work for You<br/>
                        Gold is the name of the game in Teamfight Tactics. It allows you to do everything from level up,
                        to
                        buy new characters, to re-roll the dice and get new champions for purchase. And so a huge part
                        of
                        the game is earning as much money as you can. One of the most effective ways to earn gold in
                        Teamfight Tactics (as in other auto battlers) is to accrue interest. This is the money that
                        multiplies every turn depending on how much gold you end with. But, naturally, there are rules.
                        You
                        only make one extra gold for every 10 you accrue — up to a maximum of five. So you’ll make two
                        bonus
                        gold in the 20 range, three extra in the 30s, and so on. But you will still only earn five
                        interest
                        at 60 gold and beyond. So there’s very little reason to hold onto anything above 50 gold. Use
                        this
                        surplus to fish for upgrades and higher-tier champions. You can easily see how much gold you’re
                        going to earn via the gold generator icons on the left of the screen. Otherwise, mouse over the
                        gold
                        icon on the center of the screen — near the bottom. This gives a solid numerical breakdown of
                        everything you’re about to earn and why. You can see your opponent’s gold generators as well.
                        That
                        helps you know how much stash they have saved up.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Sell Your First Champion<br/>
                        It might seem counterintuitive, but if you pick a Tier Two champion from the starting champion
                        rotation, you almost always want to sell it. Why? Well for one, you want to be able to put that
                        item
                        on another champion when you’re ready to combine items. But more importantly, in the early
                        rounds,
                        you’re really only offered Tier One champions. Selling that Tier Two champ will let you double
                        the
                        amount of gold you have on you first turn. You get to double the number of champions you buy
                        from
                        two to four. There’s so much added flexibility with that and that continues on in subsequent
                        rounds!
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Losing Is Not the End<br/>
                        There’s another, slightly more painful way to make money in Teamfight Tactics. Namely, you just
                        need
                        to lose. Winning and losing streaks — specifically against other players — will earn you
                        increasing
                        amounts of gold throughout any game of Teamfight Tactics. And for obvious reasons, losing
                        streaks
                        are much easier to achieve than winning all the time. So there’s some advantage to taking your
                        pawns
                        off the board and letting them get hosed. Then, when it’s time to battle minion waves for items,
                        set
                        yourself back up for victory!
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Don’t Forget Your Items<br/>
                        Once you begin a battle in Teamfight Tactics, your roster is locked. The game might even show an
                        animation of you moving units, but if you miss the deadline, you can’t change your champions
                        until
                        the next round. You’d think the same rule would apply to items. Well… It doesn’t! Teamfight
                        Tactics
                        will let you drag and drop that all-important equipment onto any living champion that’s still on
                        the
                        board. The bonuses go into effect immediately, too. So you can give an ailing ally 200 extra
                        health
                        just as they’re about to die. This is mostly just useful if you forget to equip your lineup.
                        However, it can also be useful for split-second decision-making to turn the tide of battle. If
                        you
                        notice you have a ranger sitting in the back, for instance, and not taking damage right away,
                        it’s
                        often smart to give them a damage-boosting item. That way you get the maximum benefit from
                        having
                        them survive so long.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Assassins Are Special<br/>
                        Each class of champions has different abilities that help you bolster your lineup. But
                        Assassins, in
                        particular, have a strange interaction that isn’t really obvious — until you actually see it.
                        Whereas most heroes simply walk forward to do battle, Assassins instantly jump to the opposite
                        tile
                        from which they started. This should be familiar to you if you’ve played other auto battlers,
                        like
                        Dota Underlords. It also makes Assassins exceptionally good at counteracting powerful, but
                        fragile
                        ranged champions placed near the back.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Move Things Around<br/>
                        Speaking of Assassins, there’s one surefire way to mess with them. Just move all — or at least
                        one —
                        of your beefiest units into the rear! That will cause the backstabbing bad guys to waste time
                        chewing through your tanks. Meanwhile, your all-important ranged units can continue to fire
                        away. Of
                        course, this only works if you know your opponent has a high number of Assassins. Plan
                        accordingly!
                        Because if you’re wrong, and you place heavy-hitting melee units in the back, you can really
                        screw
                        yourself. Champions in Teamfight Tactics move pretty slowly from hex to hex. And all the time
                        they
                        spend traveling is time they’re not attacking or building up mana.

                    </p><br />
                    <p>Don’t Get Fixated<br/>
                        It’s great to create a team that gains the maximum bonus from a single class. Six Assassins with
                        super high crit damage can absolutely crush tender opponents in Teamfight Tactics. But just as
                        important as maxing out bonuses is combining them for unique benefits. Several hero classes in
                        Teamfight Tactics only max out when you have one or more of the absolute rarest characters in
                        the
                        game. These simply won’t be available to you for a while! Not to mention some classes have
                        strange
                        restrictions on them. Ninjas, in particular, only receive class bonuses if there are one or four
                        of
                        them on the board at the same time. You can waste a lot of time, health, and money trying to
                        find
                        Yasuo — to max out that Exile class bonus — or a fourth Ninja. Instead, you can supplement
                        existing
                        bonuses with a weaker secondary category. It might not be as flashy, but it will keep you on
                        winning
                        streaks and in the game longer.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>The Rarer the Better<br/>
                        Not all Teamfight Tactics champions are created equal. Some are just plain more powerful than
                        others, clearly indicated by their rarity level. Rarer heroes cost more, but usually, compensate
                        with more powerful abilities. Miss Fortune, for instance, costs five gold. But she has a massive
                        area-of-effect attack! Rarer heroes at lower levels can still absolutely overwhelm beefier, more
                        common characters. Don’t be afraid to change tactics mid-stream to support an especially
                        powerful
                        (and rare) new champion you acquire later on.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Lock in Important Purchases<br/>
                        There is a very tiny icon on the left side of your champion selection screen every round. It’s
                        shaped like a padlock, and it can be massively important. Tapping this icon will cause whatever
                        lineup of heroes you currently see to “lock” for one turn. This lets you keep rare or otherwise
                        useful heroes around until you have enough money. Don’t have five gold to buy Karthus just yet?
                        Lock
                        that lineup and use the money you earn this round to buy him next time, instead!
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Leveling Costs<br/>
                        Leveling up is very important in Teamfight Tactics. Doing so increases the number of heroes you
                        can
                        field at a time by one. So level two gives you two heroes, level three gives you three, and so
                        on.
                        At the outset, you won’t need to worry about this very much. You naturally earn one XP every
                        round —
                        more than enough to get a decent team on the board. That changes pretty quickly, though. The XP
                        cost
                        of leveling eventually skyrockets, making it almost impossible to level up without spending
                        gold.
                        Thankfully, you can do so at any time. Just look at the far left-hand side of the character
                        purchase
                        screen. You can click on your level icon to boost yourself. You’re going to need to, too. Bench
                        space becomes vital in the endgame of Teamfight Tactics, as you try to keep huge numbers of
                        duplicate characters in reserve to hit two and three star upgrades. The only guaranteed ways to
                        free
                        up space are by selling champions and leveling up. The former option is risky, since you never
                        know
                        when you might get more of a given character. The latter upsets your interest curve, but does
                        give
                        you a guaranteed benefit. You can mitigate this by buying XP in drips and drops — when you’re
                        over
                        50 gold and don’t have a champion anywhere near leveling up.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>‘Put Your Hand on That Wall’<br/>
                        The teamfight Tactics meta is constantly evolving. The game mode is still very new, after all!
                        And
                        Riot Games has been extremely good about updating it at a rapid clip. But one major tenet from
                        League of Legends itself still holds water in TFT: Stuns are very, very important. More broadly,
                        “disables” of any kind (like slowing attack speed or silencing) are incredibly good. Any lineup
                        should absolutely have at least one champion (or class of champions: like Glacier) with a good
                        disable.

                        The opening moments of Teamfight Tactics can seem intense — especially if you’ve never played
                        before. First, you have to pick from a clutch of unlabeled characters in the “group draft.” Then
                        you
                        have five champions to choose from, with very different class and origin bonuses… as well as
                        different synergies. Finally, you might get waxed on your first real battle, losing health
                        before
                        you even knew what you were doing. It’s scary! It’s daunting! It might make you not want to play
                        again.<br/>
                        Here’s the thing, though: None of that really matters. The early game in Teamfight Tactics is a
                        mess
                        no matter who you are. However, it is balanced in such a way that you can easily beat the
                        opening
                        waves of minions with little trouble. So long as you get one champion on the board, and then
                        another, and another you’re fine! Even if you lose a round or three, the amount of damage you
                        take
                        near the start is minuscule in the grand scheme of things. Accruing interest and planning out
                        your
                        team is much more important. So just get something — anything — on the board and watch how the
                        dice
                        roll from there.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Spend Money to Make Money<br/>
                        Of course, money is only useful if you spend it. If you’re only shaving off the gold you accrue
                        past
                        50 throughout a match, you should have plenty for some last-minute plays. It’s often valuable to
                        re-roll for new characters when you’re right on the cusp of leveling up a truly powerful
                        champion —
                        even if it costs you a fat wad of cash. Just make sure you wait until it really, truly matters.<br/>
                        Once you start dipping below 50 to 25 percent health, especially if you’re consistently losing,
                        it
                        might be time to make big purchases. Hunt for mid-rarity heroes you can level up somewhat
                        quickly.
                        Look for a linchpin tier five-unit you can build the rest of your team around. Level up to get
                        more
                        bodies on the board. You’ve got nothing to lose if it looks like you’re losing anyway!<br/>
