                    <h4 class="game_name">Fall guys</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>What is Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout?<br />
                        Fall Guys is a fun and friendly, multiplayer online battle royale-style game for young and old.
                        It seems to be loosely based on TV shows like Takeshi's Castle and Total Wipeout, where the
                        object is to navigate obstacles or survive long enough in mini-games in order to qualify for
                        later levels. It starts with up to 60 online players on level one, with a number of players
                        being eliminated each round until a final level with only a handful competing to be the overall
                        winner. Winning awards crowns, which can be then traded for ultra-rare costume items or emotes,
                        while every other competitor also earns in-game currency (Kudos) which can be swapped for other
                        costumes, etc. The further you get in the game, the more Kudos you receive. There are also
                        experience points awarded, which give you extra items and skins as you level up. The game runs
                        on seasons, with new items and awards being refreshed once over. You also get the choice of
                        different colour schemes for your Fall Guy, costumes or emotes every 24 hours.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Is Fall Guys safe?<br />
                        One huge benefit to Fall Guys is that it is suitable for all age groups. It has PEGI 3 rating
                        and no way to communicate inside the game apart from cute emote animations. Experienced players
                        can all communicate through the PS4 Party Chat function (for example), but if a kid is playing,
                        they will have a safe environment to do so, with little toxic behaviour in-game. This is meant
                        to be fun, rather than overly competitive. Even when you fail to qualify, you can start a new
                        round almost instantly.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>What platforms are Fall Guys available for?<br />
                        Fall Guys is currently available for PlayStation 4 and PC (through Steam). There is talk about
                        releasing versions for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and even mobile, but no confirmed plans as yet.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Fall Guys levels are split into four categories: race, survival, team and final.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Race<br />
                        Dizzy Heights<br />
                        This is a simple race level with spinning platforms to leap onto. The best tip we can give here
                        is to make sure you leap just before the "bumper" at the edge of each disc so that momentum
                        takes you onto the next.<br/>
                        Door Dash<br/>
                        One of our favourite levels. You have to bash through doors, but some of them are fake and you
                        just bounce off them. The best tip here, therefore, is to avoid blindly running at doors and
                        hang back a few beats in order to let other hapless fools find out the right path to take. Also,
                        don't jump through the doors, dive instead. That way you won't be bashed by other players
                        jumping and are more likely to be flung forwards than back.<br/>
                        Fruit Chute<br/>
                        Like many of the race games, this is fairly simple. Just avoid the giant fruit cascading down
                        the mountain. Our tip is to stay fairly central and jump over the rolling log when needed - that
                        seems to have worked most often for us.<br/>
                        Gate Crash<br/>
                        Gate Crash is different to door dash as the gates move up and down, so timing is key. Again,
                        it's a race to the end but you have to ensure you don't get stuck behind gates for long. It's
                        also worth noting that some gates move more slowly than others, so keep away from those. And
                        don't forget to jump at the end of the slime slide to get through the last gate - there's a hole
                        you fall down otherwise.<br/>
                        Hit Parade<br/>
                        Hit Parade is another simple race game with a couple of obstacles that seem to trick players
                        unless they know what they are doing. First, there are turnstiles that are easy if you follow
                        everyone else... we suggest heading to the left set of turnstiles and pushing to the right of
                        them so they turn anti-clockwise. Also, when you get to the wrecking balls, just stay completely
                        centered on the path and time your runs carefully. Finally, stay to the far left or right when
                        running up the slime hill, as obstacles can't get you there.<br/>
                        See Saw<br/>
                        Another of our absolute favorites and one level we've come first in more than once. It helps if
                        you are out in the front pack, as the seesaws will be mostly static when you get to them, but
                        remember to try to stay centered on each seesaw (near the white line) if possible, and always
                        run and jump to the static platforms when the seesaw is at its highest - you can miss and fall
                        otherwise. If you do find yourself further back, instead of jumping between see-saws, dive. That
                        way you are less likely to fall and roll off.<br/>
                        Slime Climb<br/>
                        In our opinion, this is the hardest of the race games. A lake of slime is rapidly rising, so you
                        have to navigate the obstacles and outrun it at the same time. What's most irritating is that
                        other players can get in the way. Some tactics are to use the bumpers at the beginning as
                        platforms and the "grab" button to lift yourself onto the second climb section to speed things
                        up.<br/>
                        The Whirlygig<br/>
                        This is especially tricky for new players. As well as spinning bars that you have to leap over,
                        there is a mandatory wall climb midway on the level. It's possible to jump on one of a couple of
                        yellow blocks and then again on the raised platform, but we suggest using the "grab" mechanic to
                        climb straight up as it's less fiddly and quicker.<br/>
                        Tip Toe<br/>
                        Tip Toe is quite simply a pain in the posterior. There is only one true path through the tiles
                        in front of you, but you don't initially know what it is. The rest of the tiles disappear
                        underfoot when you tread on them. Basically, let others make those mistakes, but try to keep as
                        close to the leading pack as possible so you can continue on the right path. Also, try not to
                        stand on the edge of the correct tiles as others will push you off. And don't forget to jump
                        from the last tile to the finishing line - there is a gap.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Survival<br/>
                        Block Party<br/>
                        This is a simple game where blocks will come towards you over the horizon line and you have to
                        avoid them, or they will knock you off the platform and eliminate you. We tend to find it's best
                        to first stay central, move as necessary, and then head back to the central position as you can
                        go as easily left and right as necessary. Warning though, some block formations can only be
                        avoided by jumping over or diving underneath them.<br/>
                        Jump Club<br/>
                        This is mindbogglingly simple. You start on a large disc and two bars rotate around it, knocking
                        anyone over who gets caught by them. Many run around like loons on this level, to hilarious
                        effect. However, the best tip is to stay exactly where you are and just jump over the faster bar
                        when needed. Far more often than not, you'll qualify.<br/>
                        Jump Showdown (new)<br/>
                        We haven't yet seen this game in circulation, but it is almost identical to Jump Club. The
                        difference is that you won't be able to stay where you stand because, as well as the rotating
                        bars, segments of the platform disappear at times.<br/>
                        Perfect Match<br/>
                        This is a simple memory game. You will be shown which fruit each tile represents and then one
                        will flash up on the screens around you. Just make sure you're standing on the right tile when
                        the time runs out. More fruit is added each round, but we find standing in one stop and
                        surveying first is much better than scurrying about like a maniac.<br/>
                        Roll Out<br/>
                        Like Block Party, the aim here is to avoid being pushed off the edge by obstacles, but this time
                        the entire platform rotates, with different segments moving in different directions. Our best
                        tip is to keep moving between the two segments on the furthest edges - either left or right.<br/>
                        Tail Tag<br/>
                        There are a few tips for this and it's one of our least favorite mini-games to be honest. Some
                        of the players start with a tail, some don't. The aim of the game is to ensure you have a tail
                        before the time runs out.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Team<br/>
                        Egg Scramble<br/>
                        We're not really fans of team games, as qualification is in the hands of others, not just
                        ourselves. However, Egg Scramble is one of those games where you can have more effect on the
                        outcome. After the initial dash to grab an egg and store it in your respective home, some
                        teammates - if not all - will likely head to rival "nests" to steal eggs. We find it's therefore
                        worth hanging out in our own, grabbing any prospective egg thieves from other teams.<br/>
                        Fall Ball<br/>
                        Of all the team games, this is our favourite. It's essentially Rocket League without the cars.
                        Two balls will appear on the pitch and you have to guide them in your rival team's net. There
                        are a few good tips here. If someone on your team hasn't already, consider being the goalkeeper
                        and standing just outside your net, ready to head balls away when they get near (by jumping just
                        as they get near you). Alternatively, stay in the centre circle, but just in your own half a
                        touch so the balls appearing overhead shoot towards the rival end when they hit your noggin.<br/>
                        Hoarders<br/>
                        Hoarder is a cross between Egg Scramble and Fall Ball, but this time you have to ensure that
                        more balls are in your zone when the time runs out (or, at least, you don't have the fewest). As
                        far as we can tell, this is a free-for-all and we've struggled to find tactics that make it any
                        more than random.<br/>
                        Hoopsie Daisy<br/>
                        Set in the same arena as Jinx (below) and the tag games, hoops will appear that you have to dive
                        or jump through. The team that jumps through the most progress. Our tactic in this one is to
                        pretty much stay in the same small zone, as hoops reappear regularly. If you dash around looking
                        for hoops, it's likely someone will get there first.<br/>
                        Jinx is not great, to be honest. It's another game of tag but this time you become "infected" as
                        soon as another player on a rival team touches you. If you have the lurgy, you have to try to
                        touch as many rivals as you can too. The team that has one "unjinxed" member standing wins. It's
                        general chaos and random, we find.<br/>
                        Rock 'N' Roll<br/>
                        Rock 'N' Roll is another fun team game. Three teams have to push their own respective balls down
                        a course and then into a hole at the end. The team that does so last is eliminated. Two tips:
                        try to push your ball either far left or far right at the start, moving more central after the
                        first few obstacles; and don't, whatever you do, leave your team and head to the bottom to try
                        to stop the other teams' ball. More pushers mean the ball runs more quickly, while we've never
                        seen a blocker successfully stop an opponent's ball.<br/>
                        Team Tail Tag<br/>
                        This is exactly like solo Tail Tag (above), but this time the team with the least amount of
                        tails "grabbed" by the end is eliminated. It is likewise a random free-for-all.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Final<br/>
                        Fall Mountain<br/>
                        Fall Mountain is a fun race, with similar obstacles as other rounds, but this time the aim is to
                        "grab" the crown at the end to be the overall winner. Our biggest tip here is, if you get there
                        first, don't forget to use the grab button as you jump to touch the crown. Just touching it
                        doesn't work.<br/>
                        Hex-A-Gone<br/>
                        We're quite proud that we've won a few times in Fall Guys and it's all down to Hex-A-Gone. As
                        you touch each hex tile, it disappears, leaving you or your rivals to fall to the layer below.
                        Eventually, the layers run out and all that hit the slime at the bottom are eliminated. Our tip
                        here is to make sure you run around each layer a couple of hexagons inside the perimeter.
                        preparing to jump to the nearest cluster as you get near gaps. Don't run around the outside as
                        you can sometimes fall a couple of laters at a time. And, if you can jump from the hexagon you
                        start on to another nearby as it uses up some valuable seconds.<br/>
                        Royal Fumble<br/>
                        The final, final game is Royal Fumble - yet another tail grab. Basically, one of the finalists
                        starts with the tail and the others have to chase and grab it from him or her. The one with the
                        tail at the end of the time limit is the winner. There's nowhere to hide, so there's not much
                        strategy to it, to be honest. Just pure luck.
