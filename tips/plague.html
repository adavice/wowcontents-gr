                    <h4 class="game_name">Plague Inc</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>STEP ONE<br />
                        Customize your five types of genes to either double down on a unique strength (Patho-stasis for
                        Fungus, e.g.) or else shore up a weak zone, like climate resistance or spreading bonuses for
                        environments. These aren’t unlocked by default and are overkill on easier difficulty modes, but
                        they
                        are crucial for Brutal and above and allow experienced players to fine-tune builds and
                        strategies to
                        suit both personal preferences and the situation at hand.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>STEP TWO<br />
                        Aside from the disease pick, a player’s starting location is absolutely pivotal. The spread
                        pattern
                        and rate depend heavily on the position and climate of the country of origin. It’s a Plague, Inc
                        cliche that Greenland and Madagascar end up being late-game roadblocks, becoming totally
                        inaccessible once they close borders and thereby snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. When
                        selecting the starting country, you want some land spread, usually, and islands or flights on
                        nearby
                        neighbors. Starting out in the corner position is also a mistake, though, because your disease
                        will
                        be locked-in for far too long in these isolated pockets, making detection come sooner than
                        necessary. To get to Greenland, start in northern Europe or Russia, as a bonus, cold resistance
                        will
                        help. For Madagascar, try equatorial Africa or the mid-east.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>STEP THREE<br />
                        Your first and foremost task is to spread far and wide. The transmission rate is influenced by a
                        few
                        factors. The infection stat, which is helpfully displayed on the evolution page, is the single
                        greatest factor. It is your first priority. Select the most immediately advantageous ones at the
                        start and transition to the niche cases last. In the beginning, spend as soon as points become
                        available, and pop those orange and red bubbles constantly. (If your disease is sub-Saharan, use
                        insects to spread at only move into urban biome bonuses later). Situationally the various
                        resistances will also play a role in the right environment. Russia is frigid, so cold resistance
                        confers a benefit there; first-world countries use antibiotics and other treatments so the
                        appropriate resistance is practically a must to spread effectively in that nation.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>STEP FOUR<br />
                        The game awards evolution points for infecting new countries as well as for reaching certain
                        population milestones. These are the bread-and-butter of strategy, and forming an effective
                        build
                        path depends on the nature of your disease and random events of a particular playthrough.
                        Speaking
                        generally, maximizing transmission and resistances early is a must, with an inevitable late-game
                        pivot to lethality. Something innocuous and omnipresent, like the common cold, that morphs into
                        pure
                        putrefaction in the final act. There are a few expensive symptoms that can increase lethality
                        fivefold or more.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>STEP FIVE<br />
                        The cinch to all of this is rationing and timing the ever-necessary evolution points because
                        perks
                        cost progressively more to evolve with each pick, and the points additionally become harder to
                        earn.
                        Timing this pivot takes a little practice, but you’ll get the hang of it. Parasites can afford
                        to be
                        stealthy and pool points insidiously for ages; viruses have spontaneous traits added through
                        uncontrollable mutations and must move quickly. The general scope and plan is always: lay low,
                        travel to as many countries as you can, then once you’re in position, steal the spotlight and
                        end
                        the game.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>How to get DNA points?<br />
                        Infecting greater raw numbers of people<br />
                        Killing more of its hosts<br />
                        Spreading to new countries<br />
                        Devolving traits to reclaim points (done manually, only offers a pittance)
                    </p><br />
                    <p>What are the best plague types?<br />
                        -&nbsp;Bacteria are the default, middle-of-the-road plague type. They are average in their
                        abilities
                        and
                        drawbacks, and their unique ability to research<br />
                        -&nbsp;Parasites turn the game progression upside-down: they start rather noticeable and lethal,
                        and
                        must
                        quickly evolve to blend in. Once they do, though, they are uniquely stealthy and can often
                        infect
                        the whole world before cure research begins or progresses far.<br />
                        -&nbsp;Viruses mutate new symptoms constantly throughout the game and must pay to remove them.
                        They
                        are
                        high-profile and chaotic but powerful, as mutated symptoms mean more DNA to spend
                        elsewhere.<br />
                        -&nbsp;The Fungus is slow-moving and dull but can use points to spread to new countries via its
                        Spore
                        Burst upgrade.<br />
                        -&nbsp;The Nano-Virus begins the game detected and with a worldwide effort to find its Kill-Code
                        (aka
                        cure). It has beefier stats all-around to compensate for this and has unique upgrades to slow
                        research.<br />
                        -&nbsp;The Bio-Hazard increases in lethality as time passes and must actively be reset multiple
                        times
                        to
                        avoid having the transmission rate fall below the death count.<br />
                        -&nbsp;Prions are subtle and difficult to cure but exceptionally difficult to spread.
                    </p><br />
                    <p>Unlockables and Secrets<br />
                        -&nbsp;To unlock diseases, you must beat them in a set order. Simply beat the game using the
                        previous
                        disease on normal or better.<br />
                        -&nbsp;To unlock genes from the collective pool, simply beat the game with anything.<br />
                        -&nbsp;The rarer diseases (Neurax, Necroa, Simian, Shadow plague) will all be unlocked once you
                        beat
                        the
                        game on brutal difficulty with every basic disease.<br />
                        -&nbsp;Finally, cheat codes are unlocked by beating the game on mega-brutal difficulty with
                        every
                        disease.
