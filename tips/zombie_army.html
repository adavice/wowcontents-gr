                    <p>Use Upgrade Kits<br/>
                        Upgrade kits are integral to progressing through the game. Players will find kits in each
                        chapter
                        and can use them to improve both weapons and armor. The thing to keep in mind is that these
                        can't be
                        used as soon as they are found, but players must wait until they stumble upon a workbench.
                        Quests
                        will continue to increase in difficulty, so it is a good idea to use these kits as soon as
                        players
                        can.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Pick The Right Upgrades<br/>
                        Just because the player has the ability to upgrade, doesn't mean that they should just upgrade
                        their
                        weapons randomly. There are specific kinds of upgrades that players should try to prioritize
                        first.
                        Any upgrades that add element damage to weapons are the first that players should strive for.
                        This
                        will give weapons the ability to cause more damage, and will also allow damage to spread out to
                        other zombies as well. These upgrades will provide the advantage that players need.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Grenades And Stomping Are A Godsend<br/>
                        It is incredibly important to learn to use grenades and the stomping mechanic to take care of
                        zombies. Grenades are perfect for clearing out large groups of enemies and can really come in a
                        pinch in overwhelming situations. Players should try their best to use grenades whenever they
                        see an
                        opportunity, but shouldn't overuse. Stomping is a new game mechanic that makes life a lot
                        simpler in
                        Zombie Army 4. When players don't want to waste precious ammo on stragglers, stomping on downed
                        enemies is a perfect solution. Just slide into a zombie or knock them down with melee before
                        taking
                        them out with a quick stomp.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Empty Your Lungs Efficiently<br/>
                        Using the Empty Lung mechanic is an extremely effective mechanic for players to keep in mind. It
                        can
                        help take out bosses and single enemies but is honestly a waste to use against hordes. This
                        mechanic
                        may make aiming a lot easier, but it will add a lot of time to each shot. It is a much better
                        idea
                        to switch to a secondary weapon to take out bigger hordes of enemies. Save this mechanic for
                        lining
                        up headshots on more difficult enemies.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Save Medkits<br/>
                        Medkits are an extremely limited resource and players are only capable of carrying a small
                        amount.
                        Typically these items will only be found in checkpoints and safehouses. These should be saved
                        for
                        extremely dire situations instead of wasted for every little injury. Save them up for when they
                        are
                        needed.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Use Melee<br/>
                        Melee attacks may not sound like they would be capable of doing much, but the players should
                        definitely use melee attacks ever so often. This helps players stay alive for much longer.
                        Players
                        can use melee takedowns are by far one of the most powerful attacks that players can land but
                        require players to perform ten melee attacks before the attack is charged up. The upside is that
                        if
                        players can land this attack they will earn both health and ammo to help them in their journey.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Play As A-Team<br/>
                        It is possible to play Zombie Army 4 solo, but the game truly shines when playing cooperatively.
                        Teaming up with other players is the best way to play, and players will get much more out of the
                        game. The thing about playing with someone else though is that players will need to learn how to
                        play as a team. If the player has a good weapon or full ammo it may be a better idea to let
                        their
                        partner pick up an upgrade kit or supplies. This makes sure that the whole team is stocked up
                        and
                        more prepared for the struggles ahead.
