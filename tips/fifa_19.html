                    <br />
                    <p>Intro<br/>
                        The FIFA franchise series, as one of the heavyweights of the sports gaming world, is clearly a
                        title
                        many people anxiously await every year. Now, FIFA19 is here and the game is proving to be as
                        popular
                        as many of its best-selling sequels so far. Yet, with the overall improvements on all fronts,
                        the
                        game also comes with a new level of challenge that all have to master if they want to showcase
                        their
                        best possible game. To do that, players need to have in-depth knowledge about the game and all
                        of
                        its key new features. Some of these will be minute, while others are huge and prominent in
                        literally
                        every match - however, all of these are essential for having the ability to play a great game.
                        Here
                        are the most important tips and tricks for all FIFA19 players.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Using The Driven Shot<br/>
                        A rounded player has to go for the powerful driven shot. In this version, it is used by going
                        for
                        L1, R1, and Shoot combo. At close range, the players should charge it up to the very end to get
                        a
                        guaranteed goal. The driven shot is also super-useful in one-on-one setups, while it can also
                        provide great results in volleys if they are timed right.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Keeping The Speed In Check<br/>
                        Bad players of FIFA always use the sprint button. This is a general problem for most players of
                        the
                        FIFA series, but in this edition, anyone looking to play well must tackle this. Because of this,
                        a
                        great tip is to go for a sprint only when on a counter-attack and fast goal approaches.
                        Otherwise,
                        players will only regularly lose the ball or fail to receive a pass because of being in sprint
                        mode.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Going for Timed Finishing<br/>
                        The Timed Finish feature is new in this edition of the game and it has three separate levels
                        indicating the chances for a successful goal. These indicators change the color of the selected
                        player in the moment of shot release. While Timed Fishing will not make a big difference in the
                        box,
                        any shot from a greater distance should use it, being that the feature will provide both more
                        power
                        and accuracy to the attempt.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Relying on the Ground Cross<br/>
                        This feature is not that important when playing against an AI, but it is crucial for any human
                        opponent. Basically, it is a dribble bluff move that is activated with a double press of the
                        cross.
                        Usually, the other player will not be expecting a ground cross, and pulling one off successfully
                        is
                        a great way to thin out the defensive line and build up a goal chance. Using just one of these
                        tips
                        will enhance the game of any FIFA19 players, but employing all of them is a sure way toward
                        becoming
                        an amazing FIFA game player.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Boxing The Attackers<br/>
                        FIFA19 comes with a very simple yet very effective command that is accomplished by pressing Up
                        twice
                        during an attack on the D-pad. When a player does this, the rest of the attackers in the squad
                        will
                        rush into the box, ready for a pass. This makes the chance of a successful shot inside of the
                        goal a
                        lot more likely, as well as exploiting a mistake by the defense.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Switching Players with the Right Stick<br/>
                        Usually, in FIFA19, players go for either LB or L1 to change and switch their players. However,
                        there is also the possibility of using the right stick. The reason for this is to provide a more
                        diverse player selection. L1 switches the players who are nearest to the ball. Of course, this
                        is
                        excellent for short-distance passes, but for anything longer, more players should be considered.
                        This is where the right stick comes in.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Never Missing Out On A Will-Executor Corner Or Free Kick<br/>
                        In some versions of the FIFA series, players ignored the free and corner kicks as having little
                        value - in fact, many perceived them as completely out of their control. FIFA19 is nothing like
                        that. Instead, both of these stoppage kicks can offer the potential for an easy goal for those
                        who
                        know what they are doing. This demands practice, but the main idea is to position two players
                        with a
                        chance of scoring and then chose one that seems to be better off in the last second before
                        release.
                        Then, using L2 or LT for a gentle first touch, the player should immediately go for the goal, no
                        matter where they are in the box.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Using Tactics<br/>
                        FIFA19 provides a huge range of tactical solutions for the matches, so going for the Dynamic
                        Tactic
                        menu should be a regular part of any well-rounded player. The same goes for the Quick Tactics
                        option
                        which allows for changes during the match itself. Both should be used whenever possible in or
                        before
                        a hard match.
