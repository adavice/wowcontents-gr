                    <p>Intro<br/>
                        With millions of active players, War Thunder is an immensely popular vehicle-based war combat
                        multiplayer game. For years, it's located among the top games in this genre and it is constantly
                        drawing in new users who want to jump into its fast and fun action. No matter if the newcomers
                        chose
                        to do battle in a plane, tank, or ship, they are all entering an amazing domain, especially for
                        those interested in the real-life machines of war. However, it might be strange that in spite of
                        these huge numbers and such a level of popularity, many novice War Thunder players still start
                        off
                        really badly and keep getting frustrated by bad results and short gameplay sessions where they
                        lose
                        really quickly. To help with that, here is the ultimate War Thunder beginners guide that will
                        allow
                        anyone to level up their game as soon as they start playing.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Knowing a Vehicle<br/>
                        War Thunder offers over one thousand vehicles that are ground, water, and air-based. They are
                        many
                        diverse choices in each of those categories as well, offering the new players vertigo when all
                        of
                        these are taken into consideration. But, what is important about any vehicle choice is the
                        understanding of its performance. Because of this, spending time in the hangar is essential.
                        This
                        includes reading about the vehicle, covering everything from speed to armor plating and
                        armaments.
                        Every choice comes with its advantages and downsides. The most successful players are not those
                        who
                        possess the best vehicle - there is no such thing - but those who know their vehicles of choice
                        and
                        use what they have to their highest potential.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Making the Shots Count<br/>
                        In the heat of combat, no one can blame the new War Thunder players for pushing down on that
                        fire
                        button for too long and far too often. But, a successful engagement is not determined by the
                        number
                        of shots but by their placement. This is why every new player must do whatever possible to make
                        each
                        and every shot they fire mean a good chance of connecting with their target. Otherwise, players
                        only
                        give away their position without leveraging this for the damage they cause.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Quickly moving on to the Defense<br/>
                        In War Thunder, like in real-life warfare, no one can stay on the offense all of the time.
                        Naturally, many players try to play the game like an old-school deathmatch, which includes
                        rushing
                        in and staying aggressive until they are put down. However, this style becomes boring really
                        fast.
                        Players need to learn to maneuver and quickly fall back when they are outgunned. An additional
                        factor in this regard is the ability to align the vehicle so the damage they soak up is not
                        terminal. This is a strategic way of thinking and it provides the best results in the long run.
                        Through the straightforward use of these simple elements of the War Thunder Beginner Guide,
                        anyone
                        who joins this fascinating war action game will be able to excel in it faster than they would
                        ever
                        expect.
