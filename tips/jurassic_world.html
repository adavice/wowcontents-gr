                    <br />
                    <p>Beginners Guide<br/>
                        Since Google Maps were opened to developers of apps and play-offs, there has been a massive
                        invention of AR play-offs by some big IPs. One of them is Jurassic Earth: Live. Canada,
                        Montreal,
                        and Universal city in partnership with Ludia, a big mobile-play-off developer, are set to launch
                        it
                        this year. It will be the first time that mobile play-offs introduce the Mesozoic Earth
                        behemoth's
                        thrill to life.<br/>
                        The behemoths will be able to walk and interact freely together with fans through augmented
                        reality
                        and location-based technology. Below is a guide on how to play it. Mesozoic Earth Live will be
                        the
                        third mobile play-off to partner with Ludia and Universal for the sensational Mesozoic Earth
                        movie
                        series.<br/>
                        It is set to be launched Earthwise on Google Play and the App Store just before the arrival of
                        Mesozoic Earth: the Fallen Kingdom, which is set to premiere in theatres all over Canada and the
                        United States on 22nd June 2018.<br/>

                        play-offs.<br/>

                    <p>How the Jurassic World Alive Works<br/>
                        Imagine living among behemoths that walk freely at the park, which is just a distance away from
                        your
                        house. This is the setting that the Mesozoic Earth: Live brings to your earth. It then
                        challenges
                        you to collect as much dinosaur DNA as you can. hese majestic prehistoric creatures have come
                        back
                        to take over the earth. This is after they ran away from Mesozoic Earth on the Isla Nubla Island
                        and
                        are now walking freely in the neighbourhoods and cities. As a member of the new Dinosaur
                        Protection
                        Group (DPG), you are given the mission of saving these creatures from their second extinction.
                        You
                        are then supposed to explore your neighbourhoods and towns, looking for your favourite dinos.
                        These
                        include new breeds that are more terrifying and inspiring than ever. You are supposed to
                        activate AR
                        in order to interact with these big creatures on the real earth.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>This is a thrilling experience for any player. In Mesozoic World Live, a player can collect
                        different behemoths as he explores their habitats and towns across the globe. There are many
                        exclusive dinos and free-in play-off incubators that are lying behind each corner, waiting for
                        the
                        player to discover them. Also, there are many mind-boggling creatures that have been featured in
                        the
                        Mesozoic Earth: Fallen Kingdom. What the Mesozoic Earth Live is trying to do is immerse players
                        fully into a planet infested with live dinosaurs. It is going to do this in a way that no man
                        has
                        ever imagined. The players will get an opportunity to go on an exploration expedition and
                        connect
                        with other like-minded players. They will then build and get to interact with these strong
                        ancient
                        species that they have only heard about or seen in films. To make the Mesozoic Earth Live look
                        realistic, the developers have used the most recent augmented reality (AR) technology. This will
                        allow these players to pose and capture videos and photos with all the dinosaurs they have
                        managed
                        to collect during their gameplay. To locate the creatures, players will have to use maps and
                        deploy
                        an in-activity drone that is meant for collecting DNA samples. The player then gets the ability
                        to
                        go up one level and create other behemoths that are genetically modified in the lab. They can
                        also
                        do real-time multiple players arena battle competitions where they will win rewards. Mesozoic
                        Earth
                        fans have always had a dream of interacting with these fierce and majestic creatures in their
                        real
                        lives. With the advanced augmented reality and location technology that is available today,
                        players
                        can finally make their dream come true.
